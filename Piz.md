kanban-plugin: board

## :LiBug:

- [ ] sign up page
- [ ] loading speed
- [ ] like button infinite loading


## Do now _IMPORTANT_

- [ ] migrate to MySQL
- [ ] liking, commenting, sharing, viewing post: show popup to signin when user is not logged in
- [ ] decorate profile ppage


## Do now _but not important_

- [ ] only shows form on sign-in/up pages
- [ ] noti toast


## ideas

- [ ] instead of sending messages, user can send email to other user.
