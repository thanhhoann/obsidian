# Complexity Analysis
There are mainly two methods of efficiency assessment: actual testing and theoretical estimation (or simply _complexity analysis_).

Complexity analysis reflects the relationship between the time and space resources required for algorithm execution and the size of the input data.Â **It describes the trend of growth in the time and space required by the algorithm as the size of the input data increases**. This definition might sound complex, but we can break it down into three key points to understand it better.

# Balancing Time & Space
**Lowering time complexity usually comes at the cost of increased space complexity, and vice versa**.

The approach of sacrificing memory space to improve algorithm speed is known as "space-time tradeoff"; the reverse is known as "time-space tradeoff".

The choice depends on which aspect we value more. In most cases, time is more precious than space, so "space-time tradeoff" is often the more common strategy. Of course, controlling space complexity is also very important when dealing with large volumes of data.
