# Why lowering time complexity is increase space complexity ?
- Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to find your favorite toy car. If all the toys are just thrown into the box without any order, it will take you a long time to find the car because you have to look through every single toy one by one. This is like having a high time complexity, which means it takes a lot of time to find what you're looking for.
- Now, let's say you decide to organize the toys in the box. You put all the cars together in one corner, the dolls in another corner, and the building blocks in another corner. This way, when you want to find your toy car, you only need to look in the car corner, and you'll find it much faster. This is like having a low time complexity, which means it takes less time to find what you're looking for.
- However, to organize the toys like this, you need to have separate spaces or corners for each type of toy. This means you need more space in the box to keep everything organized. This is like having a higher space complexity, which means you need more space or memory to store things in an organized way.
- So, when you make it faster to find things (lower time complexity), you often need to use more space or memory to keep things organized (higher space complexity). It's like a trade-off: you can either have a messy box where it takes a long time to find things, or you can have an organized box where you can find things quickly, but you need more space to keep everything organized.
