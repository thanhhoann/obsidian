- When creating a new project, make sure to not focus entirely on _database schema_, instead create a basic user-application authentication schema. After that, focus on creating UI, then improve the schema from that point on.
```
Create new project
-> User Auth Schema
	-> UI (just basics, dont perfect everything)
		-> Update database schema with UI
```
