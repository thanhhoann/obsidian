## IT Project
### Idea
> Problem: University lacks of a community for 
> 	students
> 		sharing thesis ideas
> 		get notifi on college scholarships
> 		create groups
		collaboration?

- AI integrated
- LLM, Huggingface

### Practical Problem
University (e.g for IU) is lacking of a community that gathers alumnis, or students together for the purpose of sharing knowledge.

### Research Area
A social networking site built for students at IU to share their ideas or completed thesis projects. The site acts as a social media, so students can interact with each other. On the other hand, it also acts as a library for thesis ideas. 

### Research Question
1. What format could student share on the site? Ideas (text) or Report (PDF)?
-> If it's PDF, where to store it? Free tier or subscription on cloud services?
2. How to check if the student is IU-related or not?
3. AI integration?

### Research Answer
- I don't like to spend money, so I'll stick to free tier (text only)
- String validation on student number
- AI for chatbot to index the searching idea, or simply gather all ideas to create a new one (if the student ask to create a new one)
