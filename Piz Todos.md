## What can be improved ?
### Use level-based dark colors
- **Level 0 (Base)**: Used for the primary background.
- **Level 1–2 (lighten by 4-6%)**: Ideal for buttons, cards, or small elevated surfaces.
- **Level 3–4 (8-10%)**: Reserved for more prominent elements like modals or dialogs.
- **Level 5 **: Used for highly interactive or focus states like hover effects.
