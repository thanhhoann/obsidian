# Algorithms
- We can liken data structures and algorithms to building blocks. 
- The blocks represent data, the shape and connection method of the blocks represent data structures, and the steps of assembling the blocks correspond to algorithms.

## Complexity Analysis
- For loop : the number of iterations is known in advance.
- While loops provide more flexibility than for loops, especially since they allow for custom initialization and modification of the condition variable at each step.
- Although iteration and recursion can achieve the same results from a computational standpoint, they represent two entirely different paradigms of thinking and problem-solving.
  - Iteration: Solves problems "from the bottom up." It starts with the most basic steps, and then repeatedly adds or accumulates these steps until the task is complete.
  - Recursion: Solves problems "from the top down." It breaks down the original problem into smaller sub-problems, each of which has the same form as the original problem. These sub-problems are then further decomposed into even smaller sub-problems, stopping at the base case whose solution is known.
