## General
- The Pragmatic Programmer
> This book provides technical and professional practical advice for developers. It examines what it means to be a modern developer, covering topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques. Even though it was written in 1999, it is still valid in many aspects. The unique thing about this book is that it teaches you pragmatically with a collection of tips to improve the development process.

- Modern Software Engineering
> This book focuses on building great software, where the author offers a solid framework to connect good practices such as Continuous Delivery (CD), Hexagonal Architecture, and Test-Driven Development to the main ideas in software engineering. He also writes about the history of software development and the ideas that have changed the industry.

- Software Engineering at Google
> The Software Engineering at Google book is not about programming, per se, but about the engineering practices utilized at Google to make their codebase sustainable and healthy. In this book, you will learn the difference between software engineering and programming, why the Beyonce rule is essential, and how to shift left and properly test things. Also, you will learn why they are small and frequently release importance.

## Data Structures & Algorithms
- Grokking Algorithms
> It is an easy-to-understand book on applying standard algorithms to developers' daily practical problems. It starts with sorting and searching and then moves on to data compression and artificial intelligence with code samples in Python. Probably the best book to begin your algorithm journey with.

- Introduction to Algorithms - 3rd Edition
> It is one of the most famous books on in-depth algorithms (CLRS). It represents a comprehensive guide for all readers, from beginners to professionals. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. Algorithms are described in English and pseudocode, so they can be familiar even to someone who didn’t do much coding.

## Architecture
- Fundamentals of Software Architecture
> This book offers the first thorough examination of software architecture's numerous facets. It covers architectural characteristics, patterns, component selection, diagramming and presenting architecture, evolutionary architecture, and many other topics for aspiring and practicing architects.

- Clean Architecture
> The book introduces necessary disciplines and practices for software architects using design principles to address function, component separation, and data management. It shows how to use different high-level structures for various kinds of applications and how to define appropriate boundaries and layers.

- Software Architecture: The Hard Parts
> This book reveals how to choose proper architecture for different solutions among various compromises. You will learn to analyze trade-offs, document your decisions, and understand the complexities of breaking apart monolithic applications. It also shows how to handle data in a highly distributed architecture.

## Good Practices
- Clean Code
> It is one of the most excellent software development books ever. It was written to teach software engineers the principles of writing clean programming code. The book contains many examples showing how to refactor code to be more readable and maintainable. In addition, it includes chapters on common mistakes made by all kinds of programmers and chapters explaining the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

- Head First Design Patterns
> The book describes the leading software design patterns for creating more flexible, elegant, and reusable designs without rediscovering design solutions. It is written similarly to the For Dummies series of books, meaning it is easy for beginners to understand.

- Refactoring
> In this book, Martin Fowler discusses improving the design of existing code. Refactoring is changing a software system that does not alter the code’s external behavior but improves its internal structure. In the 2nd edition of the book, Martin used JavaScript instead of Java, which was used in the 1st edition.

# Personal Development
- Atomic Habits
