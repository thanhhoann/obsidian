## 26/1
- 3 x 4 dimsum (45) = 540 cal

# summary
- BMR = 1840
- TDEE = 2850 (exercise 3-5 days per week)
- to lose 0.45kg per week, daily calorie consume < 2300

# BMR
- **BMR** is the number of calories needed to maintain basic life-sustaining functions, such as breathing, maintaining blood pressure, and digesting food. 
- Male BMR formula 
	- = 66 + (6.23 × weight in pounds) + (12.7 × height in inches) − (6.8 × age in years)
	- = 66 + (6.23 x 167.5) + (12.7 x 68.8) - (6.8 x 21)
	- = 1840.485

# TDEE
- **TDEE**, which is the total number of calories you burn including your BMR. 
- Your TDEE equals your maintenance calories. 

- **moderate exercise 3-5 days per week**
=> TDEE = 1.55 × 1840.485 = 2852.75175

# calorie deficit
- you need to eat 500 calories less than your maintenance calories a day to lose 0.45kg a week.
=> eat 2300 calorie per day to lose 0.45kg per week
