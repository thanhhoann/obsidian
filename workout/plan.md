# Diet plan
## BMR
> BMR = 10 x weight(kg) + 6.25 x height(cm) - 5 x age(years) + 5
- My BMR = 10 x 80 + 6.25 x 176 - 5 x 22 + 5 = 1795 calories/day

## TDEE 
> TDEE = BMR x Activity level
### Activity Level: 
- Sedentary (little or no exercise) : 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : 1.725
- Super active (very hard exercise & physical job or 2x training) : 1.9

Assuming 1.55, my TDEE = 1795 x 1.55 = 2784 calories/day
=> Need to - 500 calories = 2284 calories/day
